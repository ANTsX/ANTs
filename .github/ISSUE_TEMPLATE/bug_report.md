**Describe the problem**
<!-- Brief description of the problem. -->


**To Reproduce**
<!--
Steps to reproduce the problem. The majority of issues with ANTs are specific to
the data, so uploading example data will make it much easier to provide help. If
it is impossible to share the data in question, attempting to reproduce the
problem with other public data is helpful.

Even if you can't share data, please include:

 * The exact command line as it was run. Please run all commands with
   verbose output where possible. If your command takes a long time, please try
   to produce a faster example that still shows the problem (eg, by running
   fewer iterations).

 * The full verbose output printed to the terminal when you run the command. If
   this is very long, please save in a text file and upload as an attachment.

If uploading data as an attachment, please try to minimize the file size by
compressing, downsampling or otherwise creating smaller images that demonstrate
the problem.
